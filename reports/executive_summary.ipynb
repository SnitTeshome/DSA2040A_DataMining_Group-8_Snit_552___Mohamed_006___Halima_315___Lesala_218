    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Title:** Data Mining Analysis of Brazilian E-commerce Platform (Olist Dataset)  \n",
    "**Course:** Data Science Applications (DSA 2040A)  \n",
    "**Group:** Group 8  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes the Olist E-commerce dataset, a Brazilian marketplace that connects small and medium-sized retailers to customers across the country. The objective is to explore customer behavior, delivery logistics, and product trends using a complete data mining pipeline that includes ETL, EDA, modeling, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key questions addressed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What product categories are most profitable?\n",
    "- How do discounts affect sales and profit?\n",
    "- Are there regional or order-priority trends?\n",
    "- Can we segment customers or transactions using clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. ETL Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading & Inspection:** Raw CSV files from Olist are ingested and previewed to understand structure and schema.\n",
    "- **Cleaning:** Dates are parsed into datetime objects, missing values are treated, and irrelevant fields dropped.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** New columns like `profit`, `profit margin`, and `delivery_delay` are derived for better insights.\n",
    "- **Saving:** Cleaned datasets are stored in structured formats (CSV/Parquet) for efficient querying and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales Trends:** Time series plots show monthly revenue growth and peak sales months.\n",
    "- **Profitability:** Electronics and furniture consistently rank as high-profit categories.\n",
    "- **Discounts:** Analysis reveals non-linear relationships between discount levels and profitability.\n",
    "- **Geographical Patterns:** Regional heatmaps reveal top-performing states by revenue and delivery speed.\n",
    "- **Order Priority:** Boxplots show how express orders influence profit and delivery time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Mining Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering (K-Means):** Customers and transactions were grouped into segments based on spending, frequency, and location.\n",
    "- **Classification:** Attempted to predict late delivery based on product type, seller location, and shipping method.\n",
    "- **Association Rules:** Identified frequent itemsets using Apriori algorithm to suggest complementary products.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top 3 product categories by profit: Computers, Office Supplies, and Furniture.\n",
    "- Discounts beyond 20% often reduced profit margins significantly.\n",
    "- Southeast region had highest number of orders but also highest delays.\n",
    "- Three distinct customer clusters were discovered: high-spenders, regional buyers, and bargain-seekers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus marketing on high-margin categories with stable demand.\n",
    "- Limit discounts to below 20% to preserve profit.\n",
    "- Improve delivery logistics in high-traffic regions (e.g., SÃ£o Paulo).\n",
    "- Personalize offers based on customer cluster segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Tools & Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn)\n",
    "- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- **Visualization:** Power BI\n",
    "- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project effectively used the Olist dataset to explore key trends in online retail. From raw data cleaning to customer segmentation, the project highlights how data mining techniques can inform strategy, optimize logistics, and drive business insights.\n",

    "- Cluster Profiles from K-Means\n",
    "- Profit Analysis Tables by Region and Category\n"
